In the wake of the Scorching, pre-existing currencies collapsed. With trade and scavenging dominating the economy, a new currency emerged: **Gilds** and **Cogs**.

- **Gilds** (*â‚²*): Gold-plated brass coins, standardized by Eastern trade guilds. Used for major transactions.
- **Cogs** (*C*): Smaller, gear-shaped coins made of iron or copper, used for everyday purchases.
