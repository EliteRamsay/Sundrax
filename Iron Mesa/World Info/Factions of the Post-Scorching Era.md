### The Lawbringers
Former soldiers, bounty hunters, and idealists seeking to impose order in the lawless frontier. Some work for Eastern powers, enforcing their will on the resource-rich West, while others act as independent sheriffs trying to bring justice to the chaos.

### The Cinderborn
Survivors of the Scorching who believe themselves chosen by the sun. Many are mutated by solar radiation, developing strange powers or horrific deformities. Some worship the sun as a god, while others seek revenge on those they blame for their suffering.

### The Gearwright’s Union
A coalition of tinkerers, scientists, and salvagers dedicated to uncovering the secrets of pre-Scorching solar technology. Some wish to use it to rebuild civilization, others to dominate what remains.

### The Dustborn Clans
Nomadic bands of scavengers, raiders, and survivors who roam the wastelands, living off what little remains. Some are ruthless bandits, while others trade in relics and information.

### The Ember Priests
A fanatical religious order that believes the sun’s wrath was divine punishment. They seek to purge those they deem unworthy, viewing technology and unchecked ambition as heresies.

### The Eastern Exploiters
Eastern factions and corporate interests that see the ruined West as a land of untapped wealth. They strip the land of resources, enslave or push out survivors, and enforce their will with mercenary armies.
