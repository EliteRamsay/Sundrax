# The World of Sundrax: Post-Scorching Era

[[Currency]] | [[Factions of the Post-Scorching Era]] | [[Mutations & Magical Anomalies]] | [[Theories on the Scorching]]

Sundrax was once a world of balance—magic and technology thriving in their own domains, separated by geography and ideology. The West was a land of innovation, where solar-powered machines carried civilization to new heights, quite literally, with flying ships that sailed the skies. The East, by contrast, relied on magic, tradition, and raw manpower. Tensions between the two had long simmered, with skirmishes, trade disputes, and ideological clashes. But no one could have predicted what came next.

## The Scorching: A Cataclysmic Event

Four years ago, the sun unleashed a devastating solar flare, an inferno that reshaped the world. The western half of Sundrax bore the brunt of this celestial wrath. Once-thriving cities turned to molten ruins, forests became charred husks, and the lifeblood of the land—its rivers and lakes—evaporated in an instant. Few survived, only those hidden deep within the mountains, such as dwarven enclaves, or those lucky enough to be in underground shelters. The once-mighty West was reduced to a vast desert, a wasteland of shifting sands and forgotten wonders.

For a week, the East was paralyzed with fear, dreading a second catastrophe. When none came, the scavengers and opportunists moved in. The West, now seen as a graveyard of untapped resources, became a gold rush of exploitation. Cities rose again, not as bastions of civilization but as lawless hubs of trade, crime, and desperation.

## Remnants of the Scorching

Though much was lost, scattered remnants of the old world persist. Ancient ruins, those few that survived the sun’s wrath, now stand as enigmatic relics of the past. Even more tantalizing are the remains of Western technology—solar-powered devices, engines, and artifacts too complex to understand, too broken to repair, but holding secrets that could reshape the world again.

Magic and alchemy have also adapted. Fire and water magic dominate, as control over heat is now essential for survival. Yet magic itself is unpredictable—solar flares disrupt its workings, causing spells to misfire or fail outright. This instability has led to a growing reliance on steam technology, with firearms and machines taking the place of unreliable magic. Steam drills extract water from deep beneath the scorched earth, fueling the new age of industry in this lawless frontier.
## A World on the Brink

Four years have passed since the Scorching, and Sundrax is at a crossroads. The West is a land of both ruin and opportunity, where survival is brutal, and ambition is dangerous. The East continues its encroachment, carving up the fallen lands for profit. The people of the wasteland fight for their futures—some to preserve what little they have left, others to seize what was once lost.

The sun still burns high overhead, an ever-present reminder of the world’s fragility. And somewhere, in the ruins of the past, the secrets of the Scorching lie buried, waiting to be uncovered.
