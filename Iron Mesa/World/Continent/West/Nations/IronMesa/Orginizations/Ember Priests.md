A fanatical religious sect that believes the Scorching was divine judgment upon the world. The Ember Priests see themselves as messengers of the Sun-God, preaching that another cleansing fire will come, and only the faithful will be spared. They actively seek out solar relics, believing them to be holy artifacts, and often come into conflict with the Gearwrightâ€™s Union over these discoveries. Some extremists within their ranks have begun enacting "purifications," setting fire to heretical settlements and executing nonbelievers in ritualistic ceremonies. Their growing influence in Rustbank has many worried that a new wave of fanaticism is on the horizon.
