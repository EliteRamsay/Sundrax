A powerful industrial syndicate that controls the railways and scavenges remnants of solar technology. They maintain a strict monopoly on steam-powered locomotion, ensuring that the railways remain both profitable and under their control. The Union is divided into two key branches:

- [[The Engineers’ Guild]] 
    
- **[[The Iron Enforcers]]** 
    

The Union sees Rustbank as a crucial hub for their operations, funneling both raw resources and old-world relics through the town’s railway station. They often clash with local scavengers and rival factions over ownership of ancient technology.
