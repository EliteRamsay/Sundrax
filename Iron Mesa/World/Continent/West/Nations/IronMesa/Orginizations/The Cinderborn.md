The Cinderborn are those who survived the Scorching but were permanently changed by its devastating energy. Many suffer from mutationsâ€”glowing eyes, scorched skin, or even strange, fire-infused abilities. They are feared and distrusted by most, living on the outskirts of society in small, hidden enclaves. Some believe the Cinderborn are cursed, while others see them as a new evolution of humanity. A few have turned to mercenary work, while others have embraced a nomadic, cult-like existence, believing themselves to be the chosen of the Sun-God.
