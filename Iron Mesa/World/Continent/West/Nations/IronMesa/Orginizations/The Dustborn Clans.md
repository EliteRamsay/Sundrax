A loose confederation of nomadic raiders, scavengers, and traders who roam the wastelands, the Dustborn Clans see Rustbank as a vital waypoint. Some clans are peaceful traders, offering exotic goods and hard-earned knowledge of the desertâ€™s dangers. Others are ruthless raiders, pillaging settlements and hijacking trains. Each clan follows its own code, with shifting alliances and bitter feuds making their movements unpredictable. The largest and most feared of these clans, the Ash Vultures, are known for their brutal tactics and scorched-earth warfare.
