## Overview

Rustbank is a rugged frontier town nestled along the banks of the Serpent’s Vein, one of the few surviving rivers in Iron Mesa. It serves as a hub for trade, scavenging, and lawlessness in equal measure. A mix of desperate refugees, ambitious traders, and ruthless outlaws call this place home, making it a volatile yet essential waypoint for anyone navigating the western wastelands.

## Notable Locations

### The Rusted Stag (Saloon & Inn)

A two-story, steam-powered saloon that acts as the town’s social hub. The upper floor houses rooms for rent, while the main floor serves drinks, food, and information—for a price.

- **Owner:** Margot "Iron-Eye" Calloway, a former gunslinger with a mechanical left eye.
    
- **Specialties:** Sunburn Whiskey (a fiery spirit distilled with desert herbs) and Steam-Brewed Coffee.

A barely-functioning institution attempting to maintain order. The sheriff and their deputies struggle against increasing lawlessness.
